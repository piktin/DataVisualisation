# DataVisualisation
Project for the module Understanding Data Visualisation from the University of Edinburgh.

The project is assessed on the presentation about a free topic of choice. We decided to choose Climate Change as our main topic for the presentation. I chose to be a data analyst for the team and assumed the responsibility to collect, select correct types of data and analysing it. I needed to examine/consider which graphs would be best fit for the collected data and suitable for the purpose of the project.
The course did not teach on programmes/how to use coding for data visualisation, so I needed to do some self-study on playing with data and come up with the visualisations. The learning curve is challenging, yet exhilarating. There are some days where I got stuck (not on the module content or weekly task itself) but on the coding parts and could not rest until I found the solutions for the coding/visulisation. I found it quite obsessing and exciting at the same time ðŸ˜Š
